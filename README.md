# 🛡️ Rider Safety App(Rider ResQ🏍️) 

## 🚨 Problem Statement
In road accidents involving motorbikes, it's often difficult to identify the rider and quickly notify their family or emergency services. Many victims remain unidentified for crucial hours, delaying medical attention and emotional support. Additionally, when a temporary rider borrows a bike, there's often no clear way to trace who was riding it. In such emergencies, real-time identity verification and community help become essential.

## 💡 Solution
This app helps solve the problem by allowing riders to register their identity linked to their number plate. It generates a QR code that can be printed and attached to their bike. When an accident occurs, anyone can scan the code or search the number plate to:

- Access rider/emergency contact information
- Report the incident in the community
- Notify nearby hospitals or police
- Track the incident in a centralized community thread

It also supports a temporary rider feature and real-time status updates where the rider can mark themselves as safe.
